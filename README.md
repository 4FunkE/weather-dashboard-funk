# Funk-E Weather

## Description

I created this applications to make it easy for users to look up the weather from their devices. Many users ponder what the weather will be on a daily basis, so with this app they can see current and future weather forcasts. I learned how to fetch from APIs and use the data to display for users to interact with.

## Installation

To use the application users will use the URL to pull up the weather dashboard. They can then enter in a city of their choice and press search. The city will populate the page with the current weather and underneath show the 5 day forcast.
